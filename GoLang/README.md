# Data Structures and Algorithms in GoLang

In this repository we will implement efficient solutions to problems using the basic data structure and algorithms using GoLang.

The structure shall be the following:

## Data Structures

1. Arrays
2. Linked Lists
3. Queue
4. Stack
5. Recursion
6. Hash maps

## Basic Algorithms
###

You can get started by [installing Go](https://golang.org/dl/).
