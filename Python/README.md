# Data Structures & Algorithms (in Python)

This repository is divided into 4 parts. 

## 0. Unscramble CS

This folder contains some exercises (with solutions) on using python programmin for common problems. It requires no data stucture & algorithm prior knowledge

## 1. Data structures

We will solve the following problems using data structures:

#### 1. Implement a least recent used cache (Linked list)
#### 2. Find all the files with a given suffix (Recursive function)
#### 3. Implement the Hoffman encoding (Binary tree)
#### 4. Implment Windows Active Directory (Recursive function)
#### 5. Impliment a blockchain (Linked list & Hash table)
#### 6. Find the union and intersection between those two linked lists (Linked list)

## 2. Basic Algorithms

#### 1. Finding the Square Root of an Integer (Recursive function)
#### 2. Search in a Rotated Sorted Array (Binary search & Recursive function)
#### 3. Implement the Hoffman encoding (Quick sort)
#### 4. Dutch National Flag Problem 
#### 5. Autocomplete with Tries (Trie)
#### 6. Max and Min in a Unsorted Array
#### 7. HTTPRouter using a Trie (Trie)

## 3. Advanced Algorithms


#### 1. Longest Common Subsequence (Dynamic programming)
#### 2. Coin Change (Dynamic programming)
#### 3. Stock Prices (Dynamic programming)
#### 4. Route planner (A* search)
